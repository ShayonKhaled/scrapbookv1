<p>Finished How to Build a Car today. What a refreshing read it was. I always like reading autobiographies cause it&rsquo;s fun to have a peek into other people&rsquo;s lives through words. But this one was different.</p>
<p>The way it stood out was that although Adrian didn&rsquo;t shy away from the technical details of designing cars - he did break down the concepts in simple terms. I know nothing about building cars (apart from having brakes is nice) but the technical parts weren&rsquo;t overwhelming for me. They just made me more appreciative of the amazing engineering that goes behind race cars.</p>
<p>Time to pick up another book. I&rsquo;ll have to see if the school library has any more autobiographies.</p>
<p>Also, GitHub is a pain in the neck to use sometimes. Spent an hour trying to troubleshoot an issue and gave up eventually. Will try again tomorrow.</p>
