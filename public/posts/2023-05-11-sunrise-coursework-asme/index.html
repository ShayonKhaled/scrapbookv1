<p>Watched the sunrise today. Had an Introduction to Design class (which is getting easier over time weirdly&hellip;aren&rsquo;t we supposed to advance to more advanced topics?). Received a letter from ASME in the morning; had signed up as a member few weeks back. They really made that sound like a huge deal in it lol.</p>
<p>Less maker stuff, life&rsquo;s busy.</p>
<p>Oh and I&rsquo;ve set up Pasmo on my phone and linked it with Apple Pay. Will no longer have to use coins and/or physical IC card for transportation - going full cashless. Some vending machines (and all of the campus ones) also accept it, which is awesome. <em>Cashlessness is awesome.</em></p>
