<br/><br/>
<p>First day of weekend went as usual. Cleaned my room, went outside and took photos of cherry blossom (sakura).</p>
<p>Late in the night I hooked up one of the Wemos S2 Minis with my computer. No LEDs lit up so I thought it was a DOA (Dead On Arrival), but turned out these didn&rsquo;t have any onboard power indicator, just one LED connected to pin 15.</p>
<p>The code uploading process was a bit tricky as I had to do push the boot button and reset button in a certain sequence to get it to work with Arduino. And even after the code was uploaded successfully, Arduino threw an error message saying the upload was failed.</p>
<p>But the blink code was making the LED blink just fine. After some research, I found out this is a pretty well known bug that hasn&rsquo;t been fixed yet.</p>
<p>Looks like I got my hands on some boards with quite limited documentation and an user community nowhere as large as the Arduino communities.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s in for an adventure?</p>
