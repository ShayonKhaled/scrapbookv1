<p><a href="https://scrapbook.shayonkhaled.com/2023/04/23/new-design-flying-toasted-vtx/">As I posted on April 23,</a> my VTX of the tinywhoop apparently got toasted and I thought the FC part of the board had died long ago. But today, I was just looking at it and then I realized the pins inside the battery plug were way deeper than they should be.</p>
<p>After checking for a bit, I found out the problem. The pins somehow got pushed further than their usual distance so when I was connecting the battery plug, there was no connection at all. And I didn&rsquo;t care enough to check if the circuit was actually getting power and simply concluded the VTX finally died too.</p>
<p>Replaced the plug with a new one and voila, the VTX is working just fine. Wanna know the craziest part? The FC is now functioning and getting recognized by the computer too.</p>
<p>I have no idea why. Power plug issue shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with connecting to the computer, right?</p>
<p>Well, now I have a tinywhoop AIO board that faced NDE (near-death-experience), lol.</p>
