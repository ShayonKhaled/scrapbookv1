<p>So after the AIO board started working, I got excited and assembled the tinywhoop again. Then I put one of the batteries (from GNB) on charge. And then it caught fire after awhile.</p>
<p>And I was being an idiot. I left some 4S batteries on the same rack and one of them got its side burned a little bit. The 1S themselves catching fire was bad enough, but if just one of the 4S caught fire it would&rsquo;ve got much much worse.</p>
<p>I can recall charging 4S batteries (bigger ones) in my room at dorm a few months ago, before I moved my charging setup to lab where the metal rack is a safer place to charge at. But if the fire happened in my room where I literally had batteries lying on the floor, it could&rsquo;ve been really ugly. I hate to learn this the hard way but glad that no one/nothing got hurt. Except for both of the 1S batteries and 1 4S (there&rsquo;s no other damage apart from the burned side but I&rsquo;m not risking anything).</p>
<p>But this is it for me. I&rsquo;d been frustrated with flying FPV multicopters for quite some time, and this fire is the last nail in the coffin. I will still enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaBardwell">Joshua Bardwell</a>&rsquo;s videos and watching others&rsquo; builds, but it&rsquo;s not possible for me to pursue this hobby anymore. Sayonara.</p>
<p>P.S - Don&rsquo;t be like me and use subpar equipment. Stay away from cheap batteries like GNB. Go for Tattu. Charge on a metal rack.</p>
