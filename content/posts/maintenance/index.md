Found a note at the 3D printing station in lab today. Someone tried to use the printer and left some notes.

Cleaned the bed and the memory card and printed a benchie to see if the filament sensor was actually broken. Apparently it was. The printer works fine when the sensor is disabled, but it randomly triggers when enabled.

Well whatever, I guess I just have to check how much filament I have left carefully every time before starting a print. Good thing that PolyMaker filaments usually have that written on the spool.
