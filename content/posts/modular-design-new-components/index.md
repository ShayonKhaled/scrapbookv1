I've decided to take a modular approach with the design of the barcode scanner. Like it should be divided in three parts - base (where the RPI and the battery would be), grip and the top part with the barcode scanner module. So I can redesign each of the part individually and switch them out with the old design whenever I want to.

Also, the Introduction to Design course I'm taking this semester requires me to submit a final project to get the credit. I ordered some components from AliExpress for that, and they arrived today. These missile-launcher style switches are so cool, especially with the red LED!

Pretty stoked.
