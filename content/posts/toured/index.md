Went to Lake Biwa - the largest freshwater lake of Japan - with a couple of classmates. I rarely feel like visiting tourist attractions but this was fun. Due to poor planning we ended up walking around 20 KM without being able to visit the beach; but still fun.

Was totally exhausted after returning home. Crashed on the bed and slept for ten hours straight, haha.
