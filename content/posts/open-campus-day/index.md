Demonstrated our project during the Open Campus Day at the university today. The audience (consisting mostly of Japanese high school students and their guardians) were visibly impressed. The dean also visited our project quite a few times, asked a lot of questions and suggested some improvements.

It was a fun day overall. Was so tired from working all the long hours on the project for the past few days, I napped for 5 hours almost immediately after coming back to home.

We have to finish the project before the semester ends. I'm almost done though, just need to do the remaining 25% of the code.
