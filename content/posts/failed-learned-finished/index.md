Started the 15 hours print of the second RC Car Stand (I'm printing two) before leaving the lab last weekend, turned out I mistakenly had the top plate remain all the way at the bottom so the end result got messed up. But on the brighter side, my classmate taught me how to use a file to smoothen the mess-up and possibly repurpose it for something else.

Also finished one of the stands, with the anti-slip rubber mat on top and everything. Pretty proud of this one! Designed and printed a new top plate today to make room for the anti-slip rubber mat.
