I designed some 3D printed LED light bar mounts for my RC car and installed them. Happened to have some WS2812 LED bars from one of the quadcopters I built previously, which were driven by a Digispark onboard.

However, for some weird reason I couldn't program the Digispark on MacOS (last time I used Windows) so I gave up and used an extra ESP32-S2 board I had lying around. Well, at least I have Wi-Fi functionality as well.

In today's Introduction to Design class, we generated analog waves with our Arduinos and used that to drive a speaker. Easy stuff, but yeah, that's where the title of this post came from lol.

Weekend starts tomorrow.
