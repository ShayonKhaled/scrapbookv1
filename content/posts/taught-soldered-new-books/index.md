I taught my classmate how to make a basic model on Fusion360 and 3D print it. Then I soldered some LED strips cause it was a weekend and I was bored. Lastly, picked up two books from the library. I don't know if I'm gonna be reading three books at the same time, but it feels good to have as many books on my table as possible.

Took more videos today. Gonna be editing tomorrow.
