I designed a reinforced camera mount and printed it. But then after a few bumps the circuit board stopped powering up. I think I toasted the video transmitter this time too lol. Idk, I think I'll take a break from this for awhile. Not like I have enough time for two side-projects either.

I also fixed my cinewhoop and flew on campus today, only to get shut down by campus security guards for "unauthorized flying over campus" haha. Guess I've gotta get the permission from the Dean now.

But yeah, that was about it. I completed a few pending assignments over the weekends. Can't wait for the Golden Week vacation to begin.
