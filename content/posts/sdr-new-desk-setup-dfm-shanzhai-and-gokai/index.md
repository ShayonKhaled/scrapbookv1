Learned about Software Define Radio today. Pretty cool stuff, might get a dongle to try in future. Have always been into HAM radio.

The rest of the day was mostly spent on setting up desk with the new monitor and (my first mechanical) keyboard. Such a massive upgrade over the 13 screen of my laptop.

Finished the day with reading two chapters from The Hardware Hacker. Learned how to make the most fool-proof BOM, Designing for Manufacturing, Shanzhai and Gongkai. Damn, China is cool.

Gonna go to lab tomorrow to see if I can make any progress with anything. A bit bored.
