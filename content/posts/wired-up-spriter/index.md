Wired up the Spriter Pro and got it running. Pretty nice, especially the toolhead PCB with the ribbon cable made the wiring much neater - at least on the extruder side. It's still a horrible mess on the controller side. 

Time to clean up the electronics. Waiting on some DIN rails now, will be relocating electronics to the side of the printer installed on DIN rails with easier assembly. Once this thing starts looking less like a 3 feet x 3 feet time bomb, I'll start tuning the printer.
