I'm not a morning person, but sometimes I selectively am. For example, attending the Introduction to Design course (where I get to play with Arduino) 8 in the morning is something I look forward too, even though I spent the rest of the day functioning in slow motion.

Spent most of the class helping other people, as the task was nothing trivial for me. At this point I might as well even offer to volunteer as a TA lol, cause that's what I'm doing anyway.
