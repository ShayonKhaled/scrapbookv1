Today was a weekend, so didn't go to lab.

Stayed home, cooked some Japanese-styled curry, binge watched two dozens of GreatScott Videos, learned about LiFePo4 batteries and installed VMWare on my laptop. It's a MacBook Air M2 and I want to install Altium Designer on it, but unfortunately that requires Windows and running Windows on Apple Silicon Chips is a tricky process.

Only Windows 11 has an ARM version which supposedly runs on M2. Trying to download that now but the download's taking forever.
