I stopped posting after August because my site got slow to the point that it would literally take 2-3 minutes for the editing tools to load and then another few for the photo to upload. Since I'm hosting the images directly on this shared server (bad idea), I suspect having so many pictures is what causing it.

Anyway, I don't really know, I'm no web dev expert, which is why I use WordPress.

I'll look into moving my scrapbook somewhere else, or at least offload the thumbnails of the posts elsewhere. Since I usually post a week or two's worth of scrapbook content at a time, having a 2-3 minutes delay between each really kills the flow.

So, for now, I'm taking a break. The academic pressure's been crazy lately too.
