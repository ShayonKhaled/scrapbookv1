Weekend. Prepped four meals for next week, gonna do four more tomorrow.

Read a chapter from "How to Build a Car", the book turned out to be quite a page-turner for me even though I have little interest in car racing.

The Arduino Uno came with some stickers, which I put on my laptop. I really like the midnight blue color of the MacBook, but I hate how much of a fingerprint-magnet it is at the same time. Initially I thought I'd never put stickers on it and would rather have a clean look. But now because of the fingerprint issue I'm leaning more towards the software developer looks with lots of sticker.
