I needed a 3D model of this OLED display module. Since it's a very common module, I thought I'd find plenty of existing models of it online.

Well, was I wrong. The models were in abundance, yes. But the dimensions were fairly random. So I ended up taking the measurements myself and designing a model of the particular module I have based on an existing model.

Then did a quick print on the Prusa to make sure the screw holes lined up perfectly.

The slide caliper is my third hand these days.
