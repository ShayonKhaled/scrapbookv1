Had this display lying around for a long time, finally put it into use by installing Klipper Screen on the Raspberry Pi for the klipperized Sovol SV06. I must admit, this was a huge Quality of Life upgrade. 

I previously put it off because I didn't see the point of Klipper Screen as the web UI of Klipper was much faster to use. But as it turned out, standing next to the printer and running basic macros from the screen is much much easier than walking back to the computer and navigating to the web UI.
