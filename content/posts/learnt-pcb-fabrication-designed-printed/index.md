Made a PCB with a PCB Milling Machine for the first time in my life but messed up with the setup lol, so it only drilled the holes. I guess I will get it right the next time. Also I’m finally done with the 3D printed stand for my RC car (Tamiya TT-02). It took a lot of filament to print T.T but loving the way it’s looking on my desk!
