Finally coded a Happy Birthday melody for the Piano playing robot. Took all day but the end result was somewhat worth it.

But the design sucks. Once this semester ends, I'm gonna throw the whole assembly outta the window and make something else with the components.

Got done with the 3D printed laptop stand today too. It's not that sturdy and vibrates quite a bit especially when I'm trying to type something on the keyboard, but now I know what it feels like to have a laptop stand. Might get a proper metal laptop stand in future.

Also I think it's gonna work pretty okay if I use it with an external keyboard and mouse. Let's see. Might improve the grip tomorrow with anti-slip rubber mat.
