Fiddled around a bit with the gesture sensor and ESP32 S2 Mini. Found a [new](https://github.com/acrandal/RevEng_PAJ7620) library for the gesture sensor which seems to support switching the gesture sensor into gaming mode, which basically speeds it up and makes it run at 240 FPS instead of the 120 FPS. Sounds intriguing, will look into it.

Flew a few packs with the tinywhoop. I'm starting to get better at hitting gaps.
