A friend of mine was looking for broken speakers he could salvage speaker drivers from, so I took him to a Hard Off nearby, a Japanese chain shop that sells both used and junk electronics. He bought a headphone and a Bluetooth speaker from the junk section, but they turned out to be working just fine when we returned to the university lol. Not sure why they ended up in the junk section.

I really like browsing game controllers and various audio equipment in the junk section. Will probably buy something and refurbish it or turn it into a new project next semester break or something, idk.
