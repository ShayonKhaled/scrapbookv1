We installed the spindle on the CNC machine today and did a test run. Everything went good. Gonna try milling some scrap wood next.

Searched "Altium Designer vs. KiCAD" on Reddit out of curiosity and boy oh boy, people really do have strong feelings about their preferred tools. Only thing I understood is it doesn't matter whether you're good at Altium or KiCAD, what matters is whether you can make a decent PCB or not. Because at the end of the day, it's not the software that gets shipped, the PCB does.

That's a pretty helpful realization for me actually. Previously I was trying to learn only Altium (even though it's kinda slow on my virtual machine), but now I think I'm gonna focus on learning the basics of PCB designing on KiCAD first. After that it shouldn't take me much effort to transfer my experience to Altium Designer.

The lab supervisor was cleaning the Prusa MK3S today. I love this printer, it just works! Totally unlike the Anycubic I3 Mega S I had back at home, which kept breaking down every other day.
