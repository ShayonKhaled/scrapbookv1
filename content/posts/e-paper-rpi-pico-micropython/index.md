Woke up really early today. Weekend so no classes. Ended up spending the morning messing around with a Waveshare e-paper display and an RPI Pico. 

My last encounter with embedded Python was back in 2023, when I made that gesture-based macro controller with an ESP32 S2 board. But I never used this RP2040 chip before, this was the first time. 

Let's see how it goes. RPI Pico seems to be really well documented, that's a plus.
