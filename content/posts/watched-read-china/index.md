Binge-watched videos on Mechanical Engineering on YouTube for kicks. After that, started reading a book called [The Hardware Hacker: Adventures in Making and Breaking Hardware by Andrew Huang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30804383-the-hardware-hacker?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Ajl3n5Kkyv&rank=1).

The first few chapters described a lot about how electronics are manufactured in China. Learning a ton already, I think I'll look the writer up after finishing this book and see if he published any other books too.

I'm at the 104th page right now, and already want to go to China to check out the electronics scene there lol.

Sure, I can always order on AliExpress, but nothing beats the feeling of visiting an actual storefront and buying from there.
