Starting a robotics circle (basically the Japanese equivalent of a university club) in our university.

I got the idea on a whim while looking for student organizations to join, when I realized we don't have any robotics club in our university. Might as well as start one and see where that takes me.

It'll be called KUAS Roboto (Japanese pronunciation of robot).

Why not KUAS Robotics? I don't know.

Anyway, wish me luck. Put together a quick logo on Canva.
