I bought this from the Makerfaire yesterday - a strip consisting of 60 LEDs in total. The quality is pretty good and the best part is they're WS2812 protocol-compatible so I can cut it into small pieces and do so much fun stuff!

Not sure where to use it yet but for now I would love to just power it up and watch the colors change lol. Sooo soothing and therapeutic.
