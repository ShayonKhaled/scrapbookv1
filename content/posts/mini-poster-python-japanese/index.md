Designed a mini poster to keep on my desk and motivate myself whenever I'm getting cold feet with something and planning features when I'm supposed to be getting done with the functionalities first. Attended a Python class and drew a snowflake with code - among other things.

Japanese homework was fun today too. Overall, twas a good day.
