After assembling the quad yesterday, I went back to home without testing it. And when I turned it on, the flight controller was not getting power from the battery. So disassembled it, redid some connections that looked sus and put it together again, it's working fine now!Â 

Missed the sub-250g mark for 8 grams, but at 258 grams the quad feels surprisingly nimble to fly now. Significantly less quiet too. Gonna go for an outdoor flight tomorrow.
