The sunrise was absolutely surreal today.

For some reasons too long to explain here, I'm having to use various forms of USB adapters inside the barcode scanner. And my only excuse is that this is just for prototyping and they'll be swapped out for one single custom-made cable afterwards. Hopefully.

Anyway, I spent a few hours taking measurements of each connector and making CAD models of them. So I can know how much clearance I need to leave for each connector while designing.

I'm getting pretty good with Fusion 360 and 3D printing, whew.
