This is working perfectly when placed on my desk. But when I place it on the table in a well-lit area during daytime, it seems to be a bit inconsistent with the motion detection. I'm suspsecting it may be the sunlight affecting the reading of the PIR sensors. Gotta test it in the night to see if the issues persist.

Anyway, all in all, really happy with this. Love the way it looks.
