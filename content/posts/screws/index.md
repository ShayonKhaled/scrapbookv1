I want the side panels of the base to be screwable, for easier access and maintenance. So today I tried inserting some nuts into slightly undersized holes by heating them up with a soldering iron.

It turned out fairly okay, and might be something I'd do in a pinch - if I don't have access to threaded inserts. But nah, I think I'll just stick to threaded inserts for now. It's really easy to mess up the angle while pushing the nuts into the hole.
