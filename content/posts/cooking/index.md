Made some microwaveable meals today. Roasted veggies in the oven. Baked chicken breast, also in the oven.

I kind of went random with the marinade of the chicken. Korean BBQ sauce for smell and flavor, turmeric for color, garam masala and chili powder for a little bit of spiciness, and some garlic+ginger tucked under the skin. That's all. Came out pretty good.

I love unattended cooking.
