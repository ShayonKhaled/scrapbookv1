Our University is pretty new, so we didn't really have any competitive robotics teams until a few months ago when two classmates and I started a team to compete in NHK Robocon. We didn't make it past the second screening this year due to not being able to finish the robots on time. 


It's something I've been meaning to document my experience on for the last few weeks. But can't find the energy to. Can't find the energy to do anything, to be honest. 
We demonstrated our robots on Open Campus Day last weekend. It was fun to have Japanese highschoolers drive them around. 

I was thinking about writing a post on my experience on LinkedIn at least haha. We'll see. 
Down with Fever right now. And obsessed with SLS printing. 
Can I make one?
