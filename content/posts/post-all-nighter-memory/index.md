All-nighters are good to get the creative juice flowing (and submit assignments at the eleventh hour), but they are not really sustainable. Woke up feeling tired after sleeping for 3 hours this morning. Then spent the day doing basically nothing. Was planning on coding in the night but felt too exhausted to do that.

Not like I'm regretting last night, it was needed to get me unstuck from the reluctancy with coding.

Started the print of a laptop stand today.
