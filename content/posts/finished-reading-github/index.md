Finished How to Build a Car today. What a refreshing read it was. I always like reading autobiographies cause it's fun to have a peek into other people's lives through words. But this one was different.

The way it stood out was that although Adrian didn't shy away from the technical details of designing cars - he did break down the concepts in simple terms. I know nothing about building cars (apart from having brakes is nice) but the technical parts weren't overwhelming for me. They just made me more appreciative of the amazing engineering that goes behind race cars.

Time to pick up another book. I'll have to see if the school library has any more autobiographies.

Also, GitHub is a pain in the neck to use sometimes. Spent an hour trying to troubleshoot an issue and gave up eventually. Will try again tomorrow.
