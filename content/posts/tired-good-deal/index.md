Did something quite physically demanding today so didn't have the energy to go to university lab. However, my pre-loved Tattu R-Line 750mah packs are here! Ordered some xt30 connectors, balance connectors cause the prop strikes' on Tattu's ones look like disasters waiting to happen. Anyway, the price for which I got 5 of these batteries makes the deal pretty sweet anyway, not gonna complain.
