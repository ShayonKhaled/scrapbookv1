Went to university pretty early in the morning today. Had a shuttle bus to catch at 8 in the morning to travel to the other campus, but I arrived at around 6 so I just found myself a quiet corner (to be fair the whole campus was quiet) and worked on my laptop for a bit.

Later in the day I managed to daisy-chain two shift registers and control all 16 output pins of them using my Arduino, driving two LED bars.

And the first meeting of the robotics circle I'm putting together also went pretty smooth. More people than expected showed up and they looked promising. Let's see how it goes. Fingers crossed.
