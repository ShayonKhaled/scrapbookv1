I was meaning to put off the hardware design of the barcode scanner until the software was done - but whatever, I'm gonna be juggling both at the same time. That's how it makes the most sense to me. I don't particularly enjoy coding virtual stuff, I only like it when it's connected to the real world - controlling things I can touch. So there's that.

Came up with a basic design and printed the rough outline of it first to see how it feels. Instead of making significant progress with design only to find out issues way down the road in the actual print, I prefer breaking the design down into small steps and printing them sequentially. Not a filament-efficient method for sure; but R&D is supposed to cost more than production, no?
