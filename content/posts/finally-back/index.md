Spent the whole day setting up this new scrapbook using Hugo. Still have a lot to learn about Github. 
On the brighter side, from now on I will be writing posts in markdown on Visual Studio Code and then commit the changes to the Github to publish, lol. This is kinda cool.

Still using the Netlify subdomain, haven't linked it with my website's subdomain yet. Some other day, too tired tonight.
