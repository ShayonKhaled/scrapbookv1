We played a fun game in Japanese class today. There were a bunch of cards on the table with Japanese words written on them. As soon as sensei says a letter, we have to find a word that starts with that letter and pull that card. The first one to find the right card gets one point.

Japanese classes have become more chill and fun in second semester. First semester, it was an absolute roller coaster; they were moving from chapters to chapters so fast I had a hard time keeping up. Although this time the environment is relaxed, I'm actually learning more.

This is cool.
