Received my PCBs from JLCPCB today, they took only 8 days to deliver from the day I placed the order - isn't that crazy? The quality is superb too!

This time, I got someone else's design (of an ESP-01 programming shield for Arduino Uno) made by them. Next time, I'm gonna send my own design and see how that turns out.

Spent two hours trying to make a honeycomb mesh on Fusion360 with no success. Gonna try again tomorrow.

Read a few pages on fake FPGAs from The Hardware Hacker. Cleaned my closet. Took some good photos with a gatcha toy and some candles.
