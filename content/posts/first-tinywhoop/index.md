Got my first tinywhoop today - it's a HappyModel Mobeetle 7. Binding the receiver was a bit hard in the beginning but that was mostly because I have little experience with it. After binding the built-in FRSky receiver of the kwad with my radio successfully, I flew it for a bit inside a long room at university. It was pretty fun,　たのしかったです！

The main reason why I'm going smaller and smaller with every new quadcopter is convenience. I won't need to find a big empty field to fly this, I can just fly in my room or on campus any time I want, without worrying about intimidating anyone.

Made a XT60 converter for the battery to charge them with my charger. Only thing I made today, but issokay.
