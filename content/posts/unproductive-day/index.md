Today's the last day of Golden Week vacation. It's been raining since morning. Bad combo, pretty much did nothing for the whole day and felt like shit. At the end of the day, I went to the library to get some new books; to make myself feel like I've accomplished at least one thing in the day.

Didn't snap any pictures of the books so here's one of the library computer that I used to find the location of a book lol.
