Watched the sunrise today. Had an Introduction to Design class (which is getting easier over time weirdly...aren't we supposed to advance to more advanced topics?). Received a letter from ASME in the morning; had signed up as a member few weeks back. They really made that sound like a huge deal in it lol.

Less maker stuff, life's busy.

Oh and I've set up Pasmo on my phone and linked it with Apple Pay. Will no longer have to use coins and/or physical IC card for transportation - going full cashless. Some vending machines (and all of the campus ones) also accept it, which is awesome. _Cashlessness is awesome._
