Some things look good in design, but turn out to be terrible in practice.

The enclosure looked pretty nice last night. Today when I actually printed it...well - it's not looking as good.

At least I got the sensor height correct. I don't have to position my hand in any difficult way to activate the sensor, I can just my move my palm across the desk and point the finger in front of it.

But yeah, I'm feeling pretty bummed. Time to go back to the table and redesign.

Consistent improvements and iterations are where all the magic lies.
