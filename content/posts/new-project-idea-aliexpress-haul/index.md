Been seeing DIY macro keyboards like [this](https://www.hackster.io/ocr_lab/diy-mechanical-macro-keypad-ocreeb-76d00c) on the internet for the last few days. That got me thinking, should I try to make something similar but use a gesture sensor instead of keys? I've always loved the trackpad gesture features of my MacBook, an extended version of that might be intriguing. Might be quite tricky to pull off though, idk yet.

Ordered a cheap PAJ7620U2 module on AliExpress, let's see how the performance is after it arrives. Prithul also suggested me an ESP-32 based board called S2 mini, ordered two of them as well.

Stupidly cheap, has WiFi, USB C, more I/O pins than clone Arduino Nanos, small footprint - sounds good on paper.
