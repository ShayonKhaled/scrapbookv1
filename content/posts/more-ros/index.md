It's funny how fast I can go from I-don't-feel-like-doing-anything to OMG-I-am-so-obsessed-about-this-thing. The last few days went unproductive, I suddenly lost interest in tinkering with the Wemos S2 Mini. But yesterday after that random library visit I've suddenly developed a huge interest for Raspberry PI and ROS.

Spent last night binge-watching a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hjlyA2eE9A) on how the ROS transformed to what it is today. Amazing production quality and was very interesting.

Got more books on Raspberry PI and ROS today. But books aren't enough - I need to get into the real thing. Looking into how to get started with ROS (as in installing it on my computer) and stuff right now.
