Assembled the PCB today. Everything's working fine - I'm pretty surprised about that. I thought I'd mess up with at least one component and then I'd have to order a revision. But nah, it's fully functional. 

Although there are two issues. I'm using an MPU6050 accelerometer on the PCB, but I mistakenly wrote "ADXL345" in the label which is another model. And, I forgot to make the corners of the PCB rounded lol. 

Anyway, minor issues aside, I'm really loving how the PCB looks.
