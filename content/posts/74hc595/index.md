Had a little bit of free time so I came to lab and tried to get a shift register (74HC595) to work with my Arduino. It'll be covered in our coursework in a few weeks anyway, might as well as get a head start. Couldn't finish the code so left it for tomorrow.

I also had a tiny bit of filament left from a past project, so used it up to print a cat. The filament was pretty moist so the print came out pretty bad. But hey, it's a cat!
