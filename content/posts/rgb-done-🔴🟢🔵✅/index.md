Previously, the RGB effects on the Macro Controller and the Gesture sensor couldn't function at the same time. Rewrote some bits of the code utilizing Python's Asyncio library - now both are working at the same time.

It's also increased the user experience quite a bit - now the light turns blue for a split second whenever a gesture is made. The immediate response made it much easier to use.

Really proud of how this one's come out.
