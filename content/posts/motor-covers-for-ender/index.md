Printed some motors covers for the Ender's stepper motors. Used Galaxy Black filament from Prusa, printed upside down on PEO sheet. Came out really beautiful. 

The stock Ender looked like someone put it together using spare parts from other printers. These printed parts really changing up the look haha.
