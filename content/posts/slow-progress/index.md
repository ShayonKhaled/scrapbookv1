Finished the circuitry of the car ECU simulator today, which honestly wasn't that hard. The three potentiometers will be used to control the value of three different engine sensor' data which would be sent through the CAN bus.

Time to code the thing.

Really tired with moving and figuring my shit out at the new place. Haven't been able to focus on anything much in the last few days. Plus the weather is sooo exhausting. SO HOT. Gosh.
