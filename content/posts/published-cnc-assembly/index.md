Kinda run out of things to do. But well, at least I printed a nameplate of the model of my RC car and put that on the stand. Also uploaded my very first design on Thingiverse, which is also the RC Stand.

Gonna ask one professor if I can assemble the CNC machine at the electronics workshop (it's been sitting there for awhile, just need to do the wiring and circuits). And also gonna ask another professor if he needs any help with soldering, as I'm looking for something to practice with.
