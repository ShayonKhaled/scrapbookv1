Updating two displays at the same time! Utilizing the chip-select-pin-switching method. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUtP28HTYLQ) used the same method, I just had to make some minor modifications in his example code to use my round displays with a different chip.

This is quite magical.
