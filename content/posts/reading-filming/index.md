Read a few pages from The Design of Everyday Things. It's not really fun, but interesting indeed. The problem is that, I find a lot of non-fiction books to be fun. But if they're not interesting, well, I generally don't finish them. Let's see if I finish this one.

I also took a lot of videos today, mostly of myself working on random stuff. It's fun to record memories - hopefully I can watch them and reminiscence a few years from now.

Worked a little bit on the barcode scanner project.
