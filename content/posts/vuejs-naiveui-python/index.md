Finally worked on something after a few days. My sleep cycle was kinda messed up so I went to lab at 5 in the morning, cooked up a front-end for the project I've been working on using VueJS, NaiveUI and then attended the Python coding class.

Fun day overall. Felt good to be back to my Maker self.

I think I might change the logo to something classier though - it doesn't really go with the kind of vibes I'm looking for.
