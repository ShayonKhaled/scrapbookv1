My quadcopter's beeper (the alarm that goes off in case the battery gets disconnected after a crash, so I could find the quadcopter from the sound) got triggered this morning after a short flight indoor. It wasn't responding to the kill button, and the sound was really getting on my nerves. Finally decided to cut the battery wire to kill the power, but the alarm stopped as soon as the tip of the cutters touched the circuit. Perhaps I shorted something. Weird.

Flashed CircuitPython on my ESP32 board. Have been procrastinating on the barcode scanner, so gonna finish the gesture sensor instead. Call it productive procrastination.

Making an enclosure for it on Fusion 360 as well.
