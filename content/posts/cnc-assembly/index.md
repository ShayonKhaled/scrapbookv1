Got a fun job to do. This Stepmaster D series 2 has been sitting 70% assembled at the workshop for the last two years because the students who were working on this gave up. So I've got the permission from Professor to finish the rest of the work and get this thing running. 

  
Today was mostly spent on trying to understand what's been done so far and going through all the manuals it came with. Managed to test the motors - all axes are working properly. 

Also installed new propellers, a 100 dB buzzer and XT30 battery connector on my quadcopter.
