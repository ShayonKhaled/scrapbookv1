Took a little break from making to focus on something just as important - eating healthy. Getting into meal-prepping, so I can cook a large batch of meals on weekend, freeze them and eat them for the rest of the week.

The main challenge is to find a bunch of recipes I can make easily, would enjoy eating, and can freeze and reheat without much hassles.

Started off with a simple rice and chicken mince stir fry bento, along with oven baked lemon pepper chicken breast. Might try freezing pasta next, let's see.

Tinkering with food is pretty fun for me.
