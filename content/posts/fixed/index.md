Fixed the connector of the battery charger. Grasshopper is ready to fly again.

Feeling a bit off lately. Not unproductive in general, cause I'm somewhat doing okay with other stuff. Just not with making and tinkering with electronics.

But that's okay. I don't have to do my best every day, sometimes it's fine to be a little demotivated with stuff.
