Woke up late and spent all day sleepy. Tried to get some work done but had no idea what to do. Started a print which didn't adhere to the bed and I just decided to go home instead of cleaning the bed. Went to the local game store which has a junk electronics section, to look for something to scavenge components from but didn't find anything interesting.

Tomorrow will go better. Enjoy a picture of the _RC Car Workstation_ we have at the workshop, featuring a supervisor's car and my car (the one with wheels taken off).
