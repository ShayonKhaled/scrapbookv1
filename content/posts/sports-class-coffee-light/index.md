Had sports class in the morning today. It's really fun; last semester I got soccer which wasn't my cup of tea. But this semester we're playing with Frisbee and stuff lol.

Also, bought this caramel latte from konbini today. The can looks glossy but it actually has a matte finishing, quite firm to hold (doesn't bend easily like flimsy pepsi cans) and has a smooth taste. Think I'll drink this sometimes when I need that sugar. Much better than bottled coffee.

Chopped up my WS2812 strip into five small strips. Maybe I'll make an RGB light for product photography, if I get time. The last few days have been really hectic.
