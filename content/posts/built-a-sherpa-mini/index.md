I got a roll of Overture ABS in the diamond grey color and absolutely loving it. This time I actually took my time to tune the flow, temperature and cooling settings so the prints are coming out awesome. 

I've printed the parts of a Sherpa Mini extruder and built it - it was very rewarding. I've decided to go with the Dragon Burner toolhead with the Voron, gotta order some fans now. 

I've decided to reprint all the V0.2 parts in this diamond grey color, so I am disassembling what I've built so far.
