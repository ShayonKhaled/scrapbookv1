Not sure if I bit more than I could chew with this project or I just procrastinated a bit too much. Awake for the second night in a row working on the circuit. My hands are tired from soldering and typing code.

But anyway, got the main board to talk with the display cluster successfully. Also made this power supply to convert the 12V (actually a bit more with lead acid batteries) of the car battery to 5V and 3.3V. Cause I actually have a 5V logic microcontroller (the Arduino) and a 3.3V logic microcontroller (the ESP32S2) in the same system, lol. Total clusterduck.  

The presentation's tomorrow. Guess I'm staying up tonight too.
