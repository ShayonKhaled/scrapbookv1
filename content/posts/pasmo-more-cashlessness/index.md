Set up Pasmo on my phone today. Basically, it's a virtual IC card that can be used as a transit card (for subway/randen/bus) as well; all I have to do is tap my card on the reader. Can charge it with Apple Pay linked to my debit card so it's a total W.

Didn't do anything else. Was too tired from yesterday's _hackathon_.
