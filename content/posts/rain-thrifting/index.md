Not really fan of the weather of Kyoto. It starts raining every now and then randomly.

Anyway, went to HardOff and bought a 30 feet (20m) long CAT6 cable and a longer DVI cable for my monitor. Let's see how fast that makes the internet now, lol.

Although I think my MacBook's WiFi module is pretty decent already.
