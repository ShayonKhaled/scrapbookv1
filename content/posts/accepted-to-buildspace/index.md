Got accepted to Season 5 of [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so). It's basically a six-week online programme  where people work on their ideas. Not too excited about it, but this should help me make some progress on the toolchanger. Besides, they have this social media called Sage which is pretty cool, really digging the minimalistic lowercase styling.
