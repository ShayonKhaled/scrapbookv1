Quite some time ago, I saw a Sriracha vending machine (I'm not kidding, it's a machine stocked with only bottles of Sriracha) around the train station I live near to. It didn't attract me much at that time. But after reading about hot sauces for months on cooking subreddits, I gave in and bought one from the vending machine to see the hype about it.

Well, I'm sold. The taste is hot but not too hot, it's like a sweet kind of hotness. Have been making sriracha mayo by mixing it with some kewpie, tastes so good. Think I'm gonna be using sriracha a lot in cooking from now on, lol.

Tastes good when mixed with BBQ sauce too.

Japan's weird.
