Read some pages from How to Build a Car. I didn't realize the writer of the book was also the race engineer of Ayrton Senna. It went into plenty of details about the crash as well as the possible reasons behind it.

Interesting.

Was busy with classes and stuff so nothing else to share. I will also pause the work on the gesture-based macro controller for the time being.
