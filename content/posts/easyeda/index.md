Used EasyEDA to draw a schematic for the display cluster part of the I2D (my preferred way of calling the Introduction to Design course) project. It's pretty intuitive.

Gonna design a PCB later, but for now I'm just gonna prototype it on breadboard first, then on a veroboard to have a temporary setup to try my codes on. I don't trust breadboard wiring for shit.
