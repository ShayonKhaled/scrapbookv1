Made a draft design and printed that out to see how it works. The handle is too square-y and there isn't enough clearance for the RPI Zero and its cable. Also the design looks too bulky now too.

Back to the drawing board, time to re-iterate. Or perhaps I'll take a break and go work on the software side for a bit.

On a side note, writing essays in Japanese is fun.
