Set up the gesture sensor with the Arduino Uno. The code uploading process on Wemos S2 is a bit cumbersome, so I'm just gonna finish the basic code using the Uno as a placeholder and then transfer the whole thing into the Wemos when it's done.

Also installed Platform IO extension on Visual Studio Code. Feels much better than Arduino IDE.
